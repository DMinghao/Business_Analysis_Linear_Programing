The firm uses two types of mixing processes. The first process uses 8 ounces of raw material in one hour and 3 hours of labor and it yields 4 ounces of each type of wine. The second process uses 6 ounces of raw material, 2 hours of labor, and yields 5 ounces of type 1 and 2 ounces of type 2 wine. Unwind Wine company has 6000 ounces of raw material and 2000 hours of labor available. Write the linear mathematical model that maximizes Unwind Wine Company’s revenue. "
